# Medieval-Battlegrounds
This repository contains the code for my turn-based multiplayer artillery game, Medieval Battlegrounds.

The game was made as part of a study at Nord University. It is not in it's final state and there is still alot of room for optimization. Development was paused just after massive changes to the game's core architecture and as a result parts of the code have not been cleaned up yet. 

Play the game in your web browser here: <br>

It is designed to be played by multiple people, but has an offline tutorial. You can open the game in multiple tabs to test against yourself.
