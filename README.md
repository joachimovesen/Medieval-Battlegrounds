# Medieval-Battlegrounds
The code for my turn-based multiplayer artillery game, Medieval Battlegrounds.

The game was made as part of a study at Nord University. It is not in it's final state and there is still alot of room for optimization, but development has been temproarily halted. Development was paused just after a huge change to the game's architecture and as a result parts of the code have not been cleaned up yet.
