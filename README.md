# Medieval-Battlegrounds
This repository contains the code for my turn-based multiplayer artillery game, Medieval Battlegrounds.

The game was made as part of a study at Nord University. I would like to resume development on this at some point and clean up all existing code to reflect all that I have learned since this project was started.

Play the game in your web browser here: <br>

It is designed to be played by multiple people, but has an offline tutorial. You can open the game in multiple tabs to test against yourself.
